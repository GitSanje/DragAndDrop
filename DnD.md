## Draggable are not detecting onClick Event 
(https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/issues/800)

```
    const sensors = useSensors(
    useSensor(MouseSensor, {
        onActivation: (event) => console.log("onActivation", event), // Here!
        activationConstraint: { distance: 5 },
    }))

```
In your code, you are working with **DndKit** sensors, which are responsible for detecting and handling drag-and-drop interactions. Here’s a breakdown of the different parts, including `useSensors`, `useSensor`, and the `activationConstraint`.

### Key Concepts

1. **`useSensors`**:
   - This is a hook from the `@dnd-kit/core` package, used to combine and configure multiple sensors.
   - Sensors in **DndKit** are used to detect different types of user inputs, such as mouse movements, keyboard navigation, or touch gestures.

   In your code, you're using three types of sensors: `MouseSensor`, `PointerSensor`, and `KeyboardSensor`.

2. **`useSensor`**:
   - This hook is used to create a single sensor configuration.
   - You can pass in sensor options like constraints and event handlers (such as `onActivation`).

   Each sensor is configured to detect a particular type of input and control the drag-and-drop interaction behavior. The sensors you're working with are:

   - **`MouseSensor`**: Detects mouse interactions for dragging and dropping.
   - **`PointerSensor`**: Detects pointer interactions (used for both mouse and touch inputs, but currently commented out).
   - **`KeyboardSensor`**: Detects keyboard input for drag-and-drop accessibility (usually for users who can’t use a mouse or pointer).

3. **`activationConstraint`**:
   - The `activationConstraint` option configures a delay or distance threshold that must be met before an item can be dragged.
   - In your case, `activationConstraint: { distance: 5 }` means the user has to drag the mouse at least **5 pixels** before the drag action is activated.
   - This helps to avoid unintentional drags when the user clicks or taps but doesn't intend to move the element.

### Example Breakdown

```js
const sensors = useSensors(
    useSensor(MouseSensor, {
        onActivation: (event) => console.log("onActivation", event), // Logs when drag starts
        activationConstraint: { distance: 5 }, // Requires 5px of movement to start drag
    }),
    useSensor(KeyboardSensor, {
      coordinateGetter: sortableKeyboardCoordinates,
    }),
);
```

- **`MouseSensor`**: 
   - The `onActivation` callback is fired when the sensor is activated, meaning the drag operation is initialized after moving the mouse at least 5 pixels.
   - The `distance: 5` constraint helps prevent accidental drags when the user clicks without intending to move the element.
   
- **`KeyboardSensor`**: 
   - `coordinateGetter: sortableKeyboardCoordinates` is a function that determines how the keyboard input should move the draggable items.

### How **`activationConstraint: { distance: 5 }`** Resolves Issues

In your original `onClick` and `onChange` issues, the **problem could be related to the conflict between the `click` events and the drag activation**. When a sensor like the `MouseSensor` or `PointerSensor` is active, it might prevent other DOM events like `onClick` from firing if the drag starts too quickly.

Adding `activationConstraint: { distance: 5 }` ensures that a drag operation is only triggered after the mouse has moved by 5 pixels. This small distance prevents quick clicks or slight mouse movements from interfering with other events, allowing:

- **`onClick`** events to register properly since a simple click won’t exceed the 5-pixel threshold.
- **`onChange`** to work as expected because the input element won’t immediately trigger drag behavior unless it’s dragged a certain distance.

### Solving the `onClick` and `onChange` Issue

To solve your previous issue with `onClick` and `onChange`, ensure:
- The drag isn't triggered prematurely by adjusting the `activationConstraint`.
- You have proper separation between your dragging logic and the interactive elements like input fields and buttons.

You might also want to test with both `MouseSensor` and `PointerSensor` to see which sensor works best for your specific requirements. If the issue persists, you could explore disabling drag events while editing the column title, so the drag doesn't interfere with the input interactions.
